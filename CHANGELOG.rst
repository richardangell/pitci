Changelog
=========

This changelog follows the great advice from https://keepachangelog.com/.

Each section will have a title of the format ``X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`` giving the version of the package and the date of release of that version. Unreleased changes i.e. those that have been merged into master (e.g. with a .dev suffix) but which are not yet in a new release (on PyPI) are added to the changelog but with the title ``X.Y.Z (unreleased)``. Unreleased sections can be combined when they are released and the date of release added to the title.

Subsections for each version can be one of the following;

- ``Added`` for new features.
- ``Changed`` for changes in existing functionality.
- ``Deprecated`` for soon-to-be removed features.
- ``Removed`` for now removed features.
- ``Fixed`` for any bug fixes.
- ``Security`` in case of vulnerabilities.

Each individual change should have a link to the pull request after the description of the change.

0.3.0.dev0 (unreleased)

Added
^^^^^

- Add new ``ConformalPredictor`` abstract base class that all other conformal predictor classes will inherit from `#9 <https://github.com/richardangell/pitci/pull/9>`_
    - Add `_lookup_baseline_interval`` method in ``ConformalPredictor`` which returns the ``baseline_interval`` attribute but which can be overridden by the split conformal predictor classes or future classes where the baseline interval is not a constant value

    - The conformal predictor is calibrated at the expected level for different values of alpha
    - The conformal predictor gives the expected intervals
- Add new ``docstrings.combine_split_mixin_docs`` function to combine docstring for ``SplitConformalPredictorMixin`` and the model specific classes it will be jointly inherited with `#9 <https://github.com/richardangell/pitci/pull/9>`_

Changed
^^^^^^^

    - Remove ``predict_with_interval`` method
    - Remove ``calibrate`` method
- Revert the ``nonconformity.nonconformity_at_alpha`` function to use ``np.quantile`` but with ``interpolation="higher"`` to select the upper value if the quantile falls between two values `#9 <https://github.com/richardangell/pitci/pull/9>`_
- Abstract out calculation of nonconformity scores into a `_calculate_nonconformity_scores`` method which is implemented in ``AbsoluteErrorConformalPredictor`` and ``LeafNodeScaledConformalPredictor`` classes `#9 <https://github.com/richardangell/pitci/pull/9>`_
- Change ``_sum_dict_values`` to be a staticmethod of ``LeafNodeScaledConformalPredictor`` rather than a function in ``pitci.base`` `#9 <https://github.com/richardangell/pitci/pull/9>`_
- Change linting, tests and mypy to always run in the github actions pipeline `#9 <https://github.com/richardangell/pitci/pull/9>`_

------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Add ``train_data`` argument to the ``calibrate`` methods of ``XGBoosterLeafNodeScaledConformalPredictor`` and ``XGBSklearnLeafNodeScaledConformalPredictor`` classes to allow the user to calibrate the leaf node counts on a different (train) data sample, rather than the sample used to calibrate the interval widths (which shouldn't be the training sample) `#3 <https://github.com/richardangell/pitci/pull/3>`_
